    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img id="bioimage" src="assets\images\THE BEAR.jpg" alt="sky with brass bear" height="300" width="200">

        <p> I was born in Santa Fe, New Mexico where I lived for three years before moving to Ohio.
            Growing up as an only child, I was surrounded by animals on a small farm in Moreland Hills where I learned to handle horses.
            In 2014 I graduated high school and soon after attended Case Western for one year before transferring to John Carroll. 
            I attended JCU for another year before deciding to take time off to actually figure out what I am going to do with my life. 
            During this time, I worked at Beachwood Mall for about 8 months before finding a job with Stachowski Alpacas and Stachowski Farm, Inc.
            Working with the alpacas is definetly the best job I have had hands down. However, it is just not practical if I want to actually become my own successful, independent person. 
            This has led me to explore other educational options aside from a four year college which is when I discovered Case Coding Bootcamp. 
            I quickly signed up and soon discovered just how mindblowing the world of programming actually is.
