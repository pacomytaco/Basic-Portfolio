        <p>I was born in Santa Fe, New Mexico on the third Sunday of September, 1996. 
        My mother moved us back to Cleveland so I could obtain a decent education and be closer to our family. 
        I grew up surrounded by animals; dogs, cats, rabbits, chickens, horses and even a pig. 
        I graduated from Orange High School in 2014 and atteneded Case Wester Reserve university for one year. 
        I decided to transfer to John Carroll University for another year, but soon decided to withdraw from school again. 
        I decided to just work for a year or so to figure out what I wanted to do, before I found the Case Coding Bootcamp program.
